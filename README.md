### Hello dear reader,

This is a [NEXT.js](https://nextjs.org/) frontend for my project [bgphrases](https://github.com/triangletrianglesquareplusx/bgphrases)

Libraries that have made my life easier when working on this project:
1. [React Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/). I think they offer the best possible DX among any such library. All of the icons are awesome.
